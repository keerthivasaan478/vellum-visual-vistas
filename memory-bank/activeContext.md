## ~~Current Focus: PayPal Integration~~ (Completed)

The PayPal integration task is now complete. The system now supports a full end-to-end payment flow.

### Learnings & Patterns
- **Centralized Backend Logic:** All critical logic (database writes, invoking other functions) should be handled within Supabase Edge Functions. Client-side code should only be responsible for initiating the process and reacting to its outcome (e.g., navigating on success/error). This is more secure and easier to maintain.
- **Environment Variables:** All sensitive keys and environment-specific configuration (`PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `SUPABASE_URL`, etc.) must be stored in environment variables, not hardcoded in the source.
- **Clear User Feedback:** The application provides clear feedback to the user through dedicated success/cancellation pages and toast notifications.

## Next Steps
With the core payment flow established, the next steps are open. Potential areas to focus on include:
- Building out the user dashboard to view past orders.
- Adding more features to the product itself.
- Enhancing the UI/UX of the landing page.
